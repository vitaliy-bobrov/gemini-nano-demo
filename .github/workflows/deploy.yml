# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions.
name: Deploy Angular App to GitHub Pages

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: ['main']

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: 'pages'
  cancel-in-progress: false

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "deploy"
  build_and_deploy:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Sets up Node.js environment
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20' # Specify the Node.js version you are using
          cache: 'npm' # Enable caching for npm dependencies to speed up subsequent runs

      # Step 3: Install project dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Step 4: Build the Angular application for production
      # The --base-href flag is crucial for GitHub Pages routing.
      - name: Build application
        run: ng build --configuration production --base-href /gemini-nano-demo/

      # Step 5: Deploy the built application to GitHub Pages
